# RoO

[![Build Status](https://github.com/JonathanGarson/RoO.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/JonathanGarson/RoO.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

This project is the replication of **[Head&amp;al (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199624000357)** paper on the Laffer Curve of Rule of Origin. The objective is to reproduce the main results obtained by the authors using Julia and, eventually, improving on the speed to simulate the results. This is a last year work of the graduate program in Economics of [SciencesPo Paris Economic Department](https://www.sciencespo.fr/department-economics/), for the class of computational economics taught by Professor [Florian Oswald](https://floswald.github.io/).

**Authors : Mathilde Blanchon & Jonathan Garson & Marie-Ange Ortiz**

## Folder organisation

The folders are organised as follow:

**Data** : Contains all the necessary data for the replication of the paper in a non-proprietary formats. Data are anonymized.

**Docs** : Contains all the complementary documentation to the paper replication (the paper, the appendix, the readme).

**Original Code** : Contains both the original code in R, mathematica, and julia, as well as the data in the originary format provided in the replication package of the authors. The data are not directly available in the repo, they need to be downloaded from the replication package.

**Src** : Contains the main codes for replications (see below for more details of each code), and the test folders containing the unit tests.
